    "# A/B Testing - Frequentist approach\n",
    "A/B testing is a controlled experiment that compares two versions (A and B) to determine which performs better on a chosen metric, such as conversion rate, click-through rate, or revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key Points of A/B Testing:\n",
    "    - Random assignment: Users or subjects are randomly split into two groups to test variant A versus variant B.\n",
    "    - Hypotheses:\n",
    "        -  Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): There is no difference between A and B.\n",
    "        -  Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$): There is a difference (e.g., B performs better than A).\n",
    "    - Data collection: Collect data on user interaction with each variant.\n",
    "    - Statistical analysis: Use hypothesis testing (t-tests, z-tests, or nonparametric tests) to determine if observed differences are statistically significant.\n",
    "    - Decision making: If the null hypothesis is rejected with sufficient evidence, conclude that one variant is superior; otherwise, no difference is confirmed.\n",
    "- Practical Steps:\n",
    "    - Formulate hypotheses.\n",
    "    - Randomly assign users to groups.\n",
    "    - Run the experiment, collecting relevant metrics.\n",
    "    - Perform statistical tests to check for significant differences.\n",
    "    - Implement the winning variant based on results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A/B testing is widely used in product development, marketing, and UX research to optimize user engagement and business outcomes by data-driven decision-making. This method is a real-world application of statistical hypothesis testing designed for practical experiments involving two variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistical Errors and Power\n",
    "When you run an A/B test, you are making a decision about the whole population based on a sample. Because of sampling variation, there are two primary mistakes (errors) you can make:\n",

    "#### 1. Understand the Experiment Design\n",
    "- Clarify the goal: Increase conversion rate (the number of users who pay for the product).\n",
    "- Identify groups: “Control” (old page) vs. “Treatment” (new page).\n",
    "- Know your metrics: Focus on conversion rate, but also review related metrics like average order value or bounce rate for context.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Load and Explore the Data\n",
    "- Import all relevant data files (typically user-level logs or summaries of visits, conversions, variant assignments, etc.).\n",
    "- Use .head(), .info(), and basic plots (hist(), value_counts()) to get a sense for data shape, missingness, and distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Check Data Integrity\n",
    "- Ensure randomization: Each user should be assigned to only one group.\n",
    "- Check for duplicates and missing values.\n",
    "- Validate that test groups are balanced in size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Define Success Criteria\n",
    "- Decide on the statistical significance threshold ($\\alpha$ is standard).\n",
    "- Set the minimum detectable effect (MDE) your business cares about.\n",
    "- Clarify sample size requirements for adequate statistical power.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- Visualize conversion rates in control vs. treatment groups.\n",
    "- Plot histograms or boxplots for order value and other key metrics.\n",
    "- Summarize basic statistics: mean, median, counts, proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Statistical Testing\n",
    "- Calculate the observed difference in conversion rates.\n",
    "- Use appropriate hypothesis tests (e.g., z-test for proportions, t-test if comparing means) to assess significance.\n",
    "- Consider permutation tests if assumptions for parametric tests are questionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Interpret Results\n",
    "- Compare $\\rho-value$ to the $\\alpha$ threshold.\n",
    "- If significant: consider business and practical impact.\n",
    "- If not significant: review sample size and power—consider whether to extend testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. Additional Testing and Validation Steps\n",
    "- Common Additional Testing and Validation Steps:\n",
    "    - Permutation (Randomization) Tests: Directly estimate the null distribution of your test statistic by permuting group labels. Confirms robustness if assumptions of traditional parametric tests (like normality) are questionable.\n",
    "    - Bootstrap Confidence Intervals: Resample your observed data to estimate more robust confidence intervals for differences in conversion rate or other metrics.\n",
    "    - Subgroup Analysis: Check if effects are consistent across different customer segments (e.g., geography, device type, user tenure) to rule out confounding or strange heterogeneity.\n",
    "    - Test for Balance: Re-validate that the treatment and control groups are similar in covariates prior to treatment—imbalance could invalidate causal inference.\n",
    "    - Holdout Validation or Split-Test Replication: Run a smaller version of the experiment (or leave out a random subset as a “holdout” group) to check if effects replicate.\n",
    "    - Power Analysis Post-Hoc: Calculate the observed power of your test to help interpret non-significant results—is the test underpowered, or is there truly no effect?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If your main A/B z-test yields a p-value just above 0.05, running a permutation test and bootstrap interval can confirm whether this result is robust or might vary with sampling noise. Subgroup analysis may reveal that the treatment only helps a specific user group—affecting your rollout decision.\n",

    "## What is the Normality Assumption?\n",
    "It’s the assumption that the data (or more precisely, the sampling distribution of the test statistic) follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution. The normality assumption means the data or the sampling distribution of the test statistic follows a normal distribution ($X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$). This assumption underpins many classical tests such as the two-sample t-test used in A/B testing.\n",

    "**In formulas:**\n",

    "These methods check the stability of your result and provide alternative business-friendly metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayesian A/B Analysis**\n",
    "- In essence, Bayesian A/B testing allows you to quantify your belief about which variant is better by using probability, instead of just focusing on p-values and confidence intervals.\n",
    "    - Traditional (Frequentist): Asks, \"Assuming the variants are the same (null hypothesis), what is the probability of seeing data as extreme as what we observed?\"\n",
    "    - Bayesian: Asks, \"Given the data we have observed, what is the probability that Variant A is better than Variant B?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key Advantages:\n",
    "    - Incorporates Prior Knowledge: You can formally include what you already know (or believe) about the conversion rate before the test even starts.\n",
    "    - Intuitive Results: The output is a clear, actionable probability (e.g., \"There is a 98% chance that Variant B will generate a higher conversion rate than Variant A\").\n",
    "    - Faster Decision Making: You can often stop the test earlier because the stopping rule is based on reaching a sufficiently high probability of superiority or an acceptable expected loss, rather than a fixed sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step-by-Step Bayesian A/B Analysis\n",
    "**1. Define the Prior Distribution**\n",
    "- This is the most \"Bayesian\" step. A prior is a probability distribution representing your belief about the true conversion rate ($\\theta$) of each variant before you see any data.\n",
    "    - Common Choice: The Beta Distribution\n",
    "        - The Beta distribution is the standard choice for modeling probabilities (like conversion rates) because its values are between 0 and 1.\n",
    "        - It has two parameters: $\\alpha$ (the number of successes + 1) and $\\beta$ (the number of failures + 1).\n",
    "    - Choosing your Prior:\n",
    "        - Informative Prior: If you have historical data (e.g., from previous tests), you set $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ based on those past results.\n",
    "        - Uninformative (Flat) Prior: If you have no prior knowledge, you use $\\text{Beta}(1, 1)$, which assumes all conversion rates between 0% and 100% are equally likely. This is a good starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Prior}(\\theta) = \\text{Beta}(\\alpha_{\\text{prior}}, \\beta_{\\text{prior}})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Collect Data and Apply the Likelihood**\n",
    "Run A/B test and collect the data for each variant (A and B).\n",
    "    - Data for Variant A:\n",
    "        - $N_A$: Total visitors (trials)\n",
    "        - $k_A$: Total conversions (successes)\n",
    "    - Likelihood: The probability of observing $k_A$ successes out of $N_A$ trials, given the true conversion rate $\\theta_A$, is modeled by the Binomial Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Calculate the Posterior Distribution**\n",
    "This is where Bayes' Theorem comes into play. The posterior distribution represents your updated belief about the true conversion rate after seeing the data.\n",
    "- The Math: Thanks to the mathematical convenience of the Beta-Binomial conjugate prior relationship, the posterior distribution is also a Beta Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Posterior}(\\theta) = \\text{Beta}(\\alpha_{\\text{posterior}}, \\beta_{\\text{posterior}})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Update Rule:\n",
    "    - $\\alpha_{\\text{posterior}} = \\alpha_{\\text{prior}} + k$ (prior successes + observed successes)\n",
    "    - $\\beta_{\\text{posterior}} = \\beta_{\\text{prior}} + (N - k)$ (prior failures + observed failures)\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate a separate posterior distribution for both Variant A and Variant B.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Calculate Decision Metrics**<br>\n",
    "Instead of a p-value, you get a distribution for the potential outcome of each variant. You use these distributions to calculate highly actionable metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Probability of Superiority (PoS)\n",
    "- What it is: The probability that the true conversion rate of one variant (e.g., B) is greater than the true conversion rate of another variant (A).\n",
    "- How to Calculate: You simulate (or sample) thousands of times from both posterior distributions ($\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$) and count how often the sampled value for $\\theta_B$ is greater than $\\theta_A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{PoS}(\\text{B} > \\text{A}) = P(\\theta_B > \\theta_A \\, | \\, \\text{Data})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision: If $\\text{PoS}(\\text{B} > \\text{A})$ is, say, 95% or higher, you have a strong reason to choose B.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Expected Loss (EL)\n",
    "- What it is: The expected loss if you were to deploy the wrong variant. For example, the expected loss if you choose Variant A, but Variant B is actually better.\n",
    "- Decision: You typically choose the variant that minimizes the expected loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Decision and Stopping Rule** <br>\n",
    "Unlike frequentist tests which require pre-calculating a sample size, Bayesian tests allow for continuous monitoring (though you should still let it run for a sufficient time, typically one or more full business cycles, to account for time-based variability).\n",
    "- The Rule: Stop the test and declare a winner when the PoS reaches a predetermined threshold (e.g., 95%, 99%) AND the data size is sufficient to reflect typical user behavior (e.g., a week or two). "

    "    - A (Uninformative Prior): The flat prior quickly shifts to the observed data, resulting in a posterior centered near 1.6% (8 successes out of 500 is a huge influence on a Beta(1,1) prior). This would likely lead to B being declared the winner quickly.\n",
    "    - A (Informative Prior): The many historical data points \"pull\" the posterior towards the long-term 3.0% rate. The small, noisy 1.6% result is dampened by the historical evidence, resulting in a posterior centered closer to 2.98% (a weighted average of 3.0% and 1.6%).\n",
    "4. Result: Using the informative prior gives a more conservative and reliable result. It essentially tells the system, \"I know the control is usually better than 1.6%, so I need more data to believe this current dip is real before I declare B a winner.\" This reduces the chance of acting on noisy, short-term data.\n",
